# Probation at Made Tech

When you join Made Tech, you'll be "on probation" for a short time.

This means your notice period is initially shorter (how long?).

At the end of the probation period, we'll either pass, fail, or extend the probation. The majority of people we hire pass.

## How do I explain probation to my direct reports?

## What if someone is worried about failing probation?
